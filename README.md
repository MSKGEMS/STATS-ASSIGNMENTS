# STATS-ASSIGNMENTS

1. Introduction
This assignment will help you to consolidate the concepts learnt in the session.
2.1. Problem Statement: STATISTICS 1

1. You survey households in your area to find the average rent they are paying. Find
the standard deviation from the following data:
$1550, $1700, $900, $850, $1000, $950.

2. Find the variance for the following set of data representing trees in California
(heights in feet):
3, 21, 98, 203, 17, 9

3. In a class on 100 students, 80 students passed in all subjects, 10 failed in one
subject, 7 failed in two subjects and 3 failed in three subjects. Find the
probability distribution of the variable for number of subjects a student from
the given class has failed in.
2.2. Problem Statement: STATISTICS 2

1. A test is conducted which is consisting of 20 MCQs (multiple choices questions)
with every MCQ having its four options out of which only one is correct.
Determine the probability that a person undertaking that test has answered
exactly 5 questions wrong.
2. A die marked A to E is rolled 50 times. Find the probability of getting a
“D” exactly 5 times.

3. Two balls are drawn at random in succession without replacement from an urn
containing 4 red balls and 6 black balls.
Find the probabilities of all the possible outcomes.

2.3. Problem Statement: STATISTICS 3

Blood glucose levels for obese patients have a mean of 100 with a standard deviation
of 15. A researcher thinks that a diet high in raw cornstarch will have a positive
effect on blood glucose levels. A sample of 36 patients who have tried the raw
cornstarch diet have a mean glucose level of 108. Test the hypothesis that the raw
cornstarch had an effect or not.
1. In one state, 52% of the voters are Republicans, and 48% are Democrats. In a
second state, 47% of the voters are Republicans, and 53% are Democrats.
Suppose a simple random sample of 100 voters are surveyed from each state.
What is the probability that the survey will show a greater percentage of
Republican voters in the second state than in the first state?
2. You take the SAT and score 1100. The mean score for the SAT is 1026 and the
standard deviation is 209. How well did you score on the test compared to the
average test taker?
2.4. Problem Statement: STATISTICS 4

1. Is gender independent of education level? A random sample of 395 people were
surveyed and each person was asked to report the highest education level they
obtained. The data that resulted from the survey is summarized in the
following table:
High-School Bachelor Masters Ph.D. Total
Female 60 54 46 41 201
Male 40 44 53 57 194
Total 100 98 99 98 395
Question: Are gender and education level dependent at 5% level of
significance? In other words, given the data collected above, is there a
relationship between the gender of an individual and the level of education
that they have obtained?

2. Using the following data, perform a one-way analysis of variance using α=.05.
Write up the results in APA format.
[Group1: 51, 45, 33, 45, 67]
[Group2: 23, 43, 23, 43, 45]
[Group3: 56, 76, 74, 87, 56]
3. Calculate F Test for given 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 5,10,15, 20, 25.
For 10, 20, 30, 40, 50:
